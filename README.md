# OneTimePad-Crypto
This Python project implements a simple cryptographic system using the One-Time Pad (OTP) method. The OTP is a symmetric encryption technique where a random key is used only once to encrypt a message. The key must be as long as the message, making it theoretically unbreakable if used correctly.
